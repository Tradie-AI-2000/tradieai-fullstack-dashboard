# Agent Architecture Backup

This directory contains a snapshot of the `agent.py` file taken on **September 26, 2025**.

This backup represents the complete, working, multi-agent system **before** it was refactored from a single-file architecture into a multi-folder, modular structure.

It can be used as a reference or a restore point.
